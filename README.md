## My process
first started with the html file and got the strucutre and content. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned
i learned that i still need to work on my semantic html a little more but also struggled a bit with the css classes. there are still some elements that i did not know and needed to look up but overall without using github copilot i was able to get my version as close to the orginal as possibl. 



### Continued development
 for future projects i would love to focus on css elements, specifically, working on classes and how to use the box model. padding, margins, etc.
overall, i felt pretty comfortable with the html aspect of this project

### Useful resources

- [Css tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - This helped me for figuring out what css elements to use. I really liked this source and will use it going forward.
- [Dev cheatsheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing sourcenwhich helped me find elements in html and css to help with the nutrition table. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a "cheatsheet".
-  Used GitHub Copilot to see where improvements could be made
